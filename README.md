# Word Frequency Analysis Using MapReduce

This project demonstrates the MapReduce paradigm by analyzing word frequencies in a collection of text files. It simulates a distributed computing approach using Python and is suitable for educational purposes or small-scale data processing tasks.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tjhoranumass/map-reduce-word-frequency.git
cd map-reduce-word-frequency
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Text Data
Create a `data/` directory in the project root and populate it with `.txt` files. Each file should contain plain text for analysis.

### 4. Run the Project
Execute the script to start the MapReduce process:
```bash
python map_reduce.py
```

### 5. Run Tests
To verify the core functionality of the MapReduce workflow:
```bash
python test_map_reduce.py
```
